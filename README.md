Human Tide Data
==============

This repository contains location data that was recorded on Friday the 9th of August, 2013 as part of the Human Tide Project (http://humantide.co.uk). The data contains the recorded movements of 9 of the 10 people as they walked along the tide. You are free to remix the data or adapt it for your own projects.

Contents
------------
The data directory contains the following:
* raw-data.json – a raw array of all the unaldulterated data points in a single JSON file.
* segments.json – a JSON data structure organised by segment ("stoppage") and person ("client_id").
* stoppages.svg – a vector image of the paths in the XML-based SVG format.
* stoppages.ai – a vector image of the paths optimised for Adobe Illustrator.

Additionally, you can use the code in the "demo" directory to explore the data, but due to browser restrictions, it has to be served over HTTP in order to load the JSON data.
